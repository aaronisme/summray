how to stub an constructor function?

sinon.stub is returend a function
if the function is in the object or module you can stub like this:

sinon.stub(object, 'method')

but what if it is a constructor funtion? and the object from that function have defined some other fucntion

like this:
```js
client = new es.client()
client.search() ...
```

client is an object and search is the function from that object. so how to stub search?

```ls
clientStub = sinon.stub(es, 'client')
clientStub.prototype.search = sinon.stub();
```
in this case any one created from clientStub will have the search function.and `clientStub.prototype.search` is also an stub
you can see stub api.

`stub.withArgs(arg1[, arg2, ...]);`
